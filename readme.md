Hello world!

My final project is a homepage that deals with gasoline prices. My wife and I are living in Leer, Germany,
and my wife is working in Oldenburg, which is approximately 60km from Leer, so a lot of driving every day.
Careful planning where and when to fill up the car at the gas station can safe hundreds of Euros a year.

Basically this homepage does 3 things:
1) It shows the actual prices of gas stations in Oldenburg and Leer, with a changeable radius from our home
or my wifes work, so you can see which is the cheapest gas station in the area.
2) It lets you compare the gas prices in Leer and Oldenburg - you can see if filling up the gas is cheaper
near home or near work
3) It gives you a prediction of the gas prices for a selected time during this day in Oldenburg, so you can see
before work if makes more sense to wait for this afternoon/evening for example

My homepage accomplishes 1 and 2 with the help of a free API (thanks Tankerkoenig.de!). The same company also provides historic data,
which I stored in a database and used that data to predict the change of the gasoline price during the day based on historic data.

I hope everyone seeing this final project is happy, my wife and I are for sure =)

Best regards from Germany,

Benjamin Nobel
